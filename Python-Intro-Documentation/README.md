## History of Python

- **Creator**: Guido van Rossum  
- **Initial Release**: 1991  
- **Current Version**: Python 3.x (as of [Python Official Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

### Timeline

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1989 | Guido van Rossum begins work on Python during Christmas holidays |
| 1991 | Python 0.9.0 released |
| 2000 | Python 2.0 released with new features like list comprehensions |
| 2008 | Python 3.0 released - not backward compatible |
| Present | Actively developed and maintained with a huge global community |

## Advantages of Python

- Easy to learn and write  
- Versatile and powerful  
- Rich set of libraries and frameworks  
- Active community and excellent documentation  
- Integrates well with other languages  

---

## Limitations of Python

- Slower execution speed compared to compiled languages  
- Not ideal for mobile app development  
- Memory consumption is higher for large-scale applications  
- Limited multi-threading support due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)  

---

## Getting Started

To get started with Python:

1. **Install Python**  
   - Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
   - Use package managers like `apt`, `yum`, `brew`, or `choco` based on your OS  

2. **Run Python**  
   - REPL: `python3` or `python`  
   - Script: `python3 script.py`  

3. **Install Packages**  
   - Use pip: `pip install <package-name>`  

4. **Example**  
```python
print("Hello, World!")
````
