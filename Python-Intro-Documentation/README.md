## Advantages of Python

- Easy to learn and write  
- Versatile and powerful  
- Rich set of libraries and frameworks  
- Active community and excellent documentation  
- Integrates well with other languages  

---

## Limitations of Python

- Slower execution speed compared to compiled languages  
- Not ideal for mobile app development  
- Memory consumption is higher for large-scale applications  
- Limited multi-threading support due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)  

---

## Getting Started

To get started with Python:

#### 1. **Install Python**  
   - Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
   - Use package managers like `apt`, `yum`, `brew`, or `choco` based on your OS  

#### 2. **Run Python**  
   - REPL: `python3` or `python`  
   - Script: `python3 script.py`  

#### 3. **Install Packages**  
   - Use pip: `pip install <package-name>`  

#### 4. **Example**  
```python
print("Hello, World!")
````

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

#### 1. **Is Python a compiled or interpreted language?**
Python is an interpreted language. Code is executed line-by-line, which makes debugging easier but may result in slower performance compared to compiled languages.

#### 2. **What is the difference between Python 2 and Python 3?**
Python 3 is the future and current standard of Python. It introduced breaking changes (like print being a function) and improved Unicode handling, libraries, and performance. Python 2 reached end-of-life in 2020.

#### 3. **Is Python suitable for large-scale applications?**
Yes, Python can be used for large-scale applications, but developers often integrate it with other technologies for performance-critical components due to Python's slower execution speed.

#### 4. **Why is Python preferred for data science and machine learning?**
Because of its simplicity and the rich ecosystem of libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, Python has become the default language in these fields.

#### 5. **What are some common Python IDEs and editors?**
Popular editors/IDEs include:
- VS Code
- PyCharm
- Jupyter Notebook
- Spyder
- Sublime Text
